Version History
-----------------






**** Version 0.2.0 ****

Functionalities include

* Used javascript to insert css based on browser height.
* Added scrollbar for accessing links outside screen area.
* Comment - FB doesn't reload whole page when clicking from
	one link to the other instead they populate the corresponding
	area. Have to look at that more precisely to be able to use
	pin/unpin button. Because if someone starts from profile
	page then goes back to homepage using Home link FB logo, then
	content script is not triggered.
